# TMDb-Movie-Data-Analysis
For this project, I selected the TMDb movie dataset from kaggle. According to kaggle, the data includes information on 10.000 movies.

I am interested in finding out which characterics make up a high rated movie on the hand and a high profit movie on the other hand. In conclusion I would also like to relate high profit and rating and see if those are correlated to each other.
